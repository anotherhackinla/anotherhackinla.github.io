<p>Congrats Trump voters of America, you've got to be celebrating your recent decision to stick it to the mainstreem politicians while making America great again in the same stroke. Surely you've been keeping track of your all-star prez-elect and not just taking peoples word for his performance (mainly his own). Well he's doing a super job! For starters he's already done quite a number of things never before attempted by a president elect and he's not even prez yet! Awesome. Remember how he said he'd charge 35% tax to the folks over at Carrier as way to prevent them from opening a plant in Mexico? He basically ran his entire campaign on that? Well yesterday he did a victory lap around Carrier to toast a deal he brokered with Carrier. The plant is still going to Mexico and that 35% tax he promised? Not happening. And all those jobs are still going to Mexico and no penalties to carrier - but, but, but - Trump did manage to talk the good folks at Carrier into keeping 1000 jobs in Indiana where they (supposedly) belong... and all he had to do was have Mike Pence (future VP) promise loans to Carrier that the tax-payers of Indiana will cover if they can't make good. So just to be clear there are no penalties and Carrier actually gets money from the tax payers of Indiana to keep 1000 seemingly meaningless jobs they will technically be paying the salaries for well after Trump leaves the White House. This move not new actually the 'same old same old' Trump said he'd do away with. Maybe since he's not officially President it can be excused to go back on everything he promised and favor big industry. It's all part of his genius plan right?</p>
